### üîπ The Cost of Utilities

**Task**: Analyse data set sourced from Deutsche Bank between 2020-2025 which includes the monthly costs (USD) of basic utilities such as electricity, heating, cooling, water and waste removal. Present the results of the capital cities of the different continents (Europe, Middle East, Asia, N.America, S.America, Oceania and Africa), answer questions that arise from the visualised data, e.g. what is driving the increase/decrease (is it inline with inflation)?

**Skills**: Exploratory Data Analytics, Data Visualisation (Seaborn/Matplotlib), NumPy
**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn/Matplotlib

### üîπ üèéÔ∏è F1 10th Place Cup Predictor

**Task**: Analyse historical Formula 1 race data to build a predictive machine learning model that forecasts which driver will finish in 10th position for each race weekend. The game allows users to select three drivers: the main ‚Äúmagical 10th place pick‚Äù and two additional drivers for 9th and 11th positions (the exact order for these two is not critical). Focus on driver-specific performance metrics, such as average finishing position per race, trends over multiple seasons, and performance in specific race tracks or conditions, to create accurate predictions for the remainder of the 2025 season and potentially for 2026.

**Skills**: Exploratory Data Analytics, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modelling, Model Evaluation, Data Visualisation (Seaborn/Matplotlib)

**Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn/Matplotlib

***Extra Project Notes / Tips***:

***Features to consider***:

Average finishing position per driver per race.

Track-specific driver trends (e.g., driver consistently performs better on street circuits vs traditional tracks).

Temporal trends (e.g., improvement or decline across the season or era).

Weather conditions for each race weekend (if available).

***Modelling approach***:

Treat it as a classification problem to predict the driver finishing 10th.

Optionally, consider predicting positions 9‚Äì11 as a multi-class problem, but only the 10th place prediction counts toward scoring.

Evaluate models using accuracy, F1-score, or a custom scoring function aligned with the game rules.

***Visualizations***:

Driver performance trends over time.

Average finishing positions per track or race type.

### Feature importance charts from the predictive model to understand which factors influence the 10th place outcome the most.
